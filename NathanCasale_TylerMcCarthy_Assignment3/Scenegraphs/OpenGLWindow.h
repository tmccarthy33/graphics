         * normally OpenGL is for the C language (i.e. no objects). Thus all
         * Opengl functions can be called directly provided we include
         * the header files.

         * With newer modern versions of opengl, this gets messy. This is
         * because (a) we must have the correct version of the header file that
         * has all the functions in a particular OpenGL version. (b) this correct
         * file must be included at every place where we are using OpenGL
         * functions. For this simple application, that ends up being here,
         * View, ObjectInstance classes. To change the OpenGL version for any
         * reasons, all these files must be edited.
         *
         * Therefore we wrap all the OpenGL functionality in an object, which
         * we pass around. Qt has several wrapper classes, one for each version
         * of OpenGL (and even OpenGL ES). In order to make our code even
         * more independent of Qt, we create a new class OpenGLFunctions. For
         * now we make it extend the QOpenGLFunctions_3_3_Core, which
         * encapsulates all the OpenGL 3.3 core functionality.
         *
         * To change the version or even to use with a different library,
         * simply change the OpenGLFunctions class to have the correct parent
