 * This virtual class captures all the operations that a scene graph should offer.
 * It is designed to be a generic scene graph that is independent of the actual
 * rendering library. It achieves this by working with an
 * sgraph::IScenegraphRenderer virtual class.
 *
 * The scene graph provides functions to store actual geometry
 * (object instances) within itself so that they can be shared within many
 * leaves. Each node of the scene graph keeps a reference to it, enabling any
 * node of the scene graph to directly call its functions.
 *
 * Conversely the scene graph also stores references to all the nodes keyed by
 * their name. This way the scene graph can directly refer to any of its nodes
 * by name instead of traversing the tree every time to find it. This is useful
 * when nodes must be identified and animated in specific ways.
